  Updated to version 1.0
  
  Back at it again with another world recolour.
  (should be compatiable with saves, this mod only changes textures after all)
  
  This is a home planet of the forsaken. 
  
  Intended for use with the forsaken mod, but you can use it without it too if you want
  
  -Most biomes are changed to a more yellowish colour.
  -The planet map has been recoloured to match the biome change. 

 For those who are want a more vibrant "alien" enviroment.
 
 Works well with Makaru's "Fertile planet" mod.
