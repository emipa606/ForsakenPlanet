IMPORTANT: I won't be updating this mod anymore. Anyone is welcome to update it and reupload it if credit is given.





  Updated to version 1.0
  
  Back at it again with another world recolour.
  (should be compatiable with saves, this mod only changes textures after all)
  
  This is a home planet of the forsaken. 
  
  Intended for use with the forsaken mod, but you can use it without it too if you want
  
  -Most biomes are changed to a more yellowish colour.
  -The planet map has been recoloured to match the biome change. 

 For those who are want a more vibrant "alien" enviroment.
 
 Works well with Makaru's "Fertile planet" mod.
